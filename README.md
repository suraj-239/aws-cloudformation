# aws-cloudformation
simple aws cloudformation code to create vpc, subnets, instance, Db among other things. 

Me Say: Hello There
You Say: General Kenobi

Hey, here we have few yaml scripts containing cloud formation scripts to acheive few things
1> Create vpc, pub and pvt subnets, Routes, Gateways, Security Grp, Instances, Mysql DB
2> Create vpc, pub subnets, Route, Gateway, 3 instance setup (one for ansible master, 2 clients). This includes ansible pre-installed and few things already configured
3> Create vpc, pub subnets, Route, Gateway, 1 instance with ansible pre-installed 

NOTE: Still you would need to do few things, create keypair before running the script. Some versions & images are hardcoded, feel free to modify. 

PS: Enjoy, May the force be with you
